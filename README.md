# Pokemon-Weakness-Finder
Pokémon Weakness Finder is a web application that displays a Pokémon's type and its weaknesses. This application uses the PokéAPI to fetch data about Pokémon and is built with Python Flask. The site is hosted for free using Heroku. The application considers type interactions that might cancel each other out to provide accurate weakness information.
